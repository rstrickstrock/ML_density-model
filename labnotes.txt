Soboldataset: 95% train, 5% test
 Ia. >check results    - increase 5% to ??% 
 Ib. >done.   - check range of sobol parameterspace vs reg. grid spaces // covers the same parameterspace?

 Ia: (02.2_polynomial-regression/02.2_polynomial_regression_increase-testset.ipynb) between 5% and 20% it doesn't make a huge difference (?!)
     How much Datapoints are needed? The RMSE/R2 noticeably gets worse after 80% used for testing (i.e. 20% used for training). 20% of 2005 (datapoints) is 401 datapoints. 400
     is the minimum for training?
 Ib: (01_prepare_data_basis/compare_databases.ipynb) grid1296 is smaller (larger min, lower max) than grid2401. grid2401 and sobol2048 cover the same space (sobol2048 is larger for max(SigH))

Violinplot of of parameters vs density
 II.    - seaborn

sympy for (direct) funtction F(params) -> density ?

Training:
    - different random seeds
    - 20-30 retrainings of the model
    - differences in model performance for using grid/sobol databases // which is better?
    - 2nd Soboldatabase and try to reproduce model accuracy? For a more general statement if that method is good for this application/usecase?

Ranking Correlation for Y_test vs Y_prod:
    - does the model give the correct tendencies for evolutionary algos?
    
Surrogate for QM:
    - accuracy?
    - speedup? even if 1sec -> 0.01 sec per evaluation there could be a huge optimization potential
